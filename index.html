        The most remarkable and unexpected fact about falling objects is that,
        if air resistance and friction are negligible, then in a given location
        all objects fall toward the center of Earth with the same constant
        acceleration, independent of their mass. This experimentally determined
        fact is unexpected, because we are so accustomed to the effects of air
        resistance and friction that we expect light objects to fall slower than
        heavy ones. The force of gravity causes objects to fall toward the
        center of Earth. The acceleration of free-falling objects is therefore
        called the acceleration due to gravity. The acceleration due to gravity
        is constant, which means we can apply the kinematics equations to any
        falling object where air resistance and friction are negligible. This
        opens a broad class of interesting situations to us. The acceleration
        due to gravity is so important that its magnitude is given its own
        symbol, g. It is constant at any given location on Earth and has the
        average value g = 9.80 m/s2.
